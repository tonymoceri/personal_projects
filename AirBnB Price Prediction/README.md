# PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This was a semester-long project completed for my M.S. program. Our goal was to clean, explore, and make conclusions from an AirBnB dataset in Manhattan, NYC. By looking at the variables included in the dataset, we hoped to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a listing based on variables such as square footage, number or bathrooms, number of bedrooms, proximity to different types of amenities, etc. This was an interesting project because we did not achieve the end result we were expecting, due to the nature of the data. Upon discussing after the project, my team and I wondered if a better approach would have been to look at NYC as a whole and incorporate the other boroughs, and not just Manhattan. Additionally, we were limited in terms of outside resources for explanations of any gaps in the data, since the repository (exploreairnbnb.com) was generated from web scraping techniques, and therefore was not an "official" dataset.
